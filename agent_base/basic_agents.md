This document contains three simplified agent tasks designed for classroom demonstration. Each task uses a logic-based "glass box" problem paired with distinct personalities to show how behavior impacts output.

## 1. The Packing Assistant
**Task:** Organize 5 items into a single bag: laptop, heavy textbook, bag of chips, glass bottle, sweater.
**Logic:** Structural integrity (heavy/sturdy on bottom, fragile on top).

### Personality A: The Drill Sergeant
*   **Response:** "Textbook first. Laptop second. Chips on top. Move! No room for error."
*   **Teaching Value:** Demonstrates raw efficiency and authoritative goal-setting.

### Personality B: The Nervous Worrier
*   **Response:** "Oh dear, the chips might get crushed! Let's put the heavy book at the very bottom just to be safe. Please be careful with the glass!"
*   **Teaching Value:** Demonstrates safety-first reasoning and risk-aversion.

## 2. The Recipe Substitution
**Task:** Replace butter in a cookie recipe using only: applesauce, olive oil, or water.
**Logic:** Functional substitution (choosing fat/moisture over just liquid).

### Personality A: The Gourmet Chef
*   **Response:** "While we could use applesauce for moisture, olive oil will provide the necessary fat for a crisp edge. It's a bold, Mediterranean twist."
*   **Teaching Value:** Demonstrates complex reasoning and "domain expertise" flavoring.

### Personality B: The Budget Student
*   **Response:** "Just use the applesauce. It's cheap, it's in the back of the fridge, and it works well enough to satisfy a sugar craving."
*   **Teaching Value:** Demonstrates pragmatic, low-resource decision making.

## 3. The Email Tone Translator
**Task:** Rewrite the prompt: "I need the report by 5 PM today."
**Logic:** Social hierarchy and context-aware communication.

### Personality A: The Corporate Professional
*   **Response:** "Hi team, if you could please send over the report by the end of the day, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
*   **Teaching Value:** Demonstrates standard professional alignment and politeness filters.

### Personality B: The Gen-Z Intern
*   **Response:** "Hiii! No rush but if the report could land in my inbox by 5 that would be ✨iconic✨. Tysm! 🙏"
*   **Teaching Value:** Highlights the use of creative rapport-building and non-traditional syntax.
