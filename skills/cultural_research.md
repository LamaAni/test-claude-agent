# Cultural Research Skill

## Skill Purpose
Research cultural norms, dress codes, religious customs, and social etiquette for destinations to ensure respectful and appropriate packing recommendations.

## When to Use
- All international trips
- Domestic trips to culturally distinct regions
- When destination has religious or conservative dress norms
- Business travel to unfamiliar cultures

## Input Parameters
- **Destination**: City/country
- **Trip purpose**: Tourism, business, religious pilgrimage
- **Traveler gender**: Male, female (dress codes often differ)
- **Planned activities**: Temple visits, business meetings, beaches

## Research Process

### Step 1: General Cultural Norms
**Look up:**
- Primary religion(s) and their influence on daily life
- Conservative vs. liberal attitudes toward dress
- Gender-specific expectations
- Urban vs. rural differences

**Sources:** Government travel advisories, cultural guides, travel forums

### Step 2: Dress Code Requirements
**Research:**
- **Religious sites:** Temple/mosque/church dress codes
- **Public spaces:** What's acceptable on streets vs. beaches
- **Business:** Professional attire standards
- **Formal events:** Wedding/dinner dress expectations
- **Gender differences:** Often stricter for women

### Step 3: Specific Restrictions
**Identify:**
- Covered shoulders/knees requirement (temples, conservative areas)
- Head covering (required or respectful)
- Shoe removal customs
- Revealing clothing prohibitions
- Colors to avoid (white for funerals, etc.)
- Cultural appropriation concerns (wearing traditional dress)

### Step 4: Seasonal/Regional Variations
- Beach resort areas may be more relaxed than inland
- Tourist areas vs. local neighborhoods
- Seasonal religious observances (Ramadan, etc.)

🌍 CULTURAL RESEARCH
Destination: [Location]

```

## Examples

**Example: Dubai, UAE**
```
Conservative Islamic culture:
- Public areas: Shoulders and knees covered
- Hotels/beach clubs: More relaxed, swimwear OK
- Women: Consider light scarf for conservative areas
- Men: Long pants for malls/restaurants
Pack: Long, loose pants; maxi skirts; light cardigan; scarf
```

**Example: Bali, Indonesia**
```
Hindu-majority, moderate:
- Temples: Shoulders/knees covered, sarong required (often provided)
- Beaches: Bikinis/swimwear acceptable
- General: Casual but respectful
Pack: Sarong (multi-use), one modest outfit for temples
```

## Best Practices
- ✅ Always research, never assume based on region alone
- ✅ Err on side of modesty when uncertain
- ✅ Pack versatile items (sarong, long cardigan) that provide coverage
- ✅ Note regional variations (tourist vs. local areas)
- ❌ Don't recommend culturally inappropriate items
- ❌ Don't assume all of region has same norms

## Integration
- Works with: Weather Lookup (modest dress in hot weather = light but covered)
- Informs: Item selection, quantities, specific gear (scarves, wraps)
