# Health & Safety Lookup Skill

## Purpose
Research health requirements, vaccinations, safety concerns, and medical preparations for destinations to ensure traveler safety and compliance.

## When to Use
- **Always** for international trips
- Destinations with known health risks (malaria, altitude, tropical diseases)
- When travelers have medical conditions
- Remote or adventure destinations
- First-time international travelers

## Input Parameters
- **Destination**: Country/region
- **Travel dates**: For seasonal disease risks
- **Traveler profiles**: Age, pre-existing conditions, pregnancy
- **Activities**: Adventure, urban, remote areas
- **Trip length**: Affects medication quantities

## Research Process

### Step 1: Required Entry Documents
**Look up:**
- Required vaccinations for entry (Yellow Fever, etc.)
- COVID-19 requirements (if still applicable)
- Proof of vaccination certificates needed
- Visa health requirements

**Sources:** CDC, WHO, embassy websites, IATA Travel Centre

**Critical:** Some vaccines must be given weeks before travel

### Step 2: Recommended Vaccinations
**Research:**
- Routine vaccines (ensure up to date): MMR, Tdap, flu
- Hepatitis A and B (food/water and blood-borne)
- Typhoid (contaminated food/water)
- Rabies (if animal exposure likely)
- Japanese Encephalitis (rural Asia)
- Meningitis (sub-Saharan Africa)
- Others based on destination

**Note timing:** Many vaccines require multiple doses over weeks/months

### Step 3: Disease Risks
**Investigate:**
- **Malaria**: Risk areas, need for prophylaxis
- **Dengue**: Mosquito-borne, no vaccine, prevention only
- **Zika**: Concern for pregnant women
- **Traveler's Diarrhea**: Common, prevention strategies
- **Altitude Sickness**: Above 2500m (8000 ft)
- **Respiratory illnesses**: Pollution, seasonal flu
- **Parasites**: Water and food-borne

**Sources:** CDC Travel Health Notices, WHO disease maps

### Step 4: Food and Water Safety
**Assess:**
- Tap water potability
- Street food safety
- Raw foods risk
- Ice in drinks
- Restaurant hygiene standards

**Guidelines:**
- "Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it"
- Bottled water only vs. tap safe
- Avoid raw vegetables, ice, unpeeled fruit

### Step 5: Medical Facilities
**Research:**
- Quality of local healthcare (excellent, adequate, limited, poor)
- Availability in tourist areas vs. remote areas
- Hospitals with international standards
- Evacuation options if serious illness/injury
- Pharmacies and medication availability

### Step 6: Safety Concerns
**Beyond health:**
- Crime rates in tourist areas
- Scams targeting tourists
- Natural disaster risks (earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes)
- Political stability
- Terrorism risk (realistic assessment)
- LGBTQ+ safety (if applicable)
- Women's safety concerns

**Sources:** Government travel advisories (US State Dept, UK FCO, etc.)

### Step 7: Travel Insurance Needs
**Recommend based on:**
- Destination healthcare quality
- Activity risk level
- Trip cost (cancellation protection)
- Pre-existing conditions
- Evacuation needs

## Best Practices
- ✅ Always check CDC and WHO official sources
- ✅ Start research 6-8 weeks before trip (vaccines take time)
- ✅ Recommend consulting travel medicine clinic
- ✅ Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- ✅ Include emergency contact numbers
- ✅ Be realistic about risks (don't over-alarm)
- ✅ Consider traveler's age and medical history
- ✅ Note seasonal disease variations
- ❌ Don't provide medical advice (recommend doctor consultation)
- ❌ Don't ignore less obvious risks (altitude, pollution)
- ❌ Don't assume all of country has same risks (varies by region)
- ❌ Don't forget to mention travel insurance importance

## Special Populations

**Pregnant Travelers:**
- Avoid Zika-risk areas
- Many vaccines contraindicated
- Recommend doctor clearance for travel
- Note altitude risks (reduced oxygen)

**Children:**
- Vaccine schedules may differ
- Malaria prophylaxis dosing by weight
- More susceptible to dehydration
- Extra safety precautions

**Elderly:**
- May need additional vaccines (shingles, pneumonia)
- Check medication interactions with prophylaxis
- Consider medical evacuation insurance
- Note physical limitations for remote areas

**Immunocompromised:**
- Many live vaccines contraindicated
- Increased infection risk
- Require specialist travel medicine consult
- Comprehensive insurance essential

## Integration
- Works with: Destination Research (medical facility quality)
- Works with: Budget Calculator (insurance costs, medication costs)
- Works with: Activity Research (adventure activities = higher risk)
- Informs: Packing list (medications, first aid, preventive items)

## Quick Reference: Common Vaccines by Region

**Southeast Asia:** Hep A, Typhoid, Japanese Encephalitis (rural), Rabies (adventure)
**Sub-Saharan Africa:** Yellow Fever, Hep A, Typhoid, Meningitis, Malaria prophylaxis
