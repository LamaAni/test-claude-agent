## Decision Framework: Should User Adjust Travel?

**Consider Rescheduling if:**
- ❌ Event makes travel impractical (everything closed)
- ❌ Safety concerns due to crowds or unrest
- ❌ Accommodation impossible to find/afford
- ❌ User's trip purpose conflicts with event (business trip during chaos)

**Great Opportunity if:**
- ✅ Once-in-a-lifetime cultural experience
- ✅ User interested in the event
- ✅ Can be prepared (book ahead, pack appropriately)
- ✅ Adds unique dimension to trip

**Neutral if:**
- ⚖️ Event is minor or localized
- ⚖️ Doesn't align with user interests but doesn't obstruct
- ⚖️ Can easily work around it

## Best Practices
- ✅ Always check event calendars
- ✅ Verify exact dates (many festivals change annually)
- ✅ Warn about booking urgency for major events
- ✅ Note both opportunities and challenges
- ✅ Provide context (why is this event significant?)
- ✅ Specific packing implications
- ❌ Don't assume events repeat same dates
- ❌ Don't overlook religious observances
- ❌ Don't only mention problems (events are often highlights!)

## Integration
- Works with: Destination Research (explains crowds)
- Works with: Budget Calculator (explains high prices)
- Works with: Cultural Research (festival dress codes)
- Informs: Packing list (special attire needs)
- Informs: Booking urgency (accommodations, tours)
