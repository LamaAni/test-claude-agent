## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Weather & Climate
- 🌡️ **Hot and Humid:** Expect to sweat, pack light breathable fabrics
- ☀️ **Intense Sun:** SPF 50+ essential, reapply every 2 hours when outdoors
- 💧 **Stay Hydrated:** Drink water constantly, 2-3L per day
- 🌧️ **Brief Showers Possible:** Light rain jacket sufficient
- 🌬️ **Humidity:** Clothes may not fully dry, pack quick-dry items

### Cultural Considerations
- 🛕 **Temple Dress Code:** Shoulders and knees covered - bring sarong or long pants
- 👙 **Beach vs. Temple:** Beachwear at beach is fine, cover up away from beach
- 🙏 **Respectful Behavior:** Remove shoes at temples, don't point feet at religious objects
- 🎁 **Tipping:** Not mandatory but appreciated (10% for good service)

### Health & Safety
- 🦟 **Mosquitoes:** Use repellent daily, especially at dawn/dusk
- 💊 **Stomach Issues:** Drink bottled water only, be cautious with street food
- 🏥 **Medical:** Good facilities in tourist areas (Seminyak, Ubud, Sanur)
- 💉 **Vaccinations:** Check with doctor, Hep A and Typhoid recommended
- 🚨 **Emergency Numbers:** 112 (general), ambulance, police

### Practical Tips
- 💵 **Money:** Withdraw cash at ATMs (better rate than exchange booths), cards widely accepted
- 🔌 **Power:** 220V, Type C/F - bring adapter
- 🛵 **Scooter:** Popular transport but dangerous - helmet essential, IDP required
- 🧺 **Laundry:** Day 5-6 wash recommended, hotels typically offer service ($10-15)
- 📱 **SIM Card:** Buy local SIM at airport for data (~$5-15)
- 🏖️ **Beach Clubs:** Consider day pass for loungers/towels/shade at nice beaches

### Cost Optimization
- ✅ **Pack:** Medications, sunscreen (1 bottle), electronics, special clothing
- 🛒 **Buy On-Site:** Extra sunscreen, bottled water, snacks, cheap beach items
- 💰 **Save Money:** Laundry instead of packing more clothes, use hotel beach towels
- 🎒 **Rent On-Site:** Snorkel gear ($10/day vs. $50 baggage if packed), surfboards

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Mid-Trip Laundry:** Pack 5 days of clothes, wash on Day 5-6, rewear. This saves 3-4 kg vs. packing 10 days of clothes.

2. **Sarong Multi-Use:** A sarong serves as beach cover-up, temple wrap, blanket, towel, and scarf. Very versatile!

3. **Reef-Safe Sunscreen:** Bali is working to protect coral reefs. Bring reef-safe sunscreen or buy locally.

4. **Swim Before Breakfast:** Beaches are calmest and least crowded early morning.

5. **Temple Timing:** Visit temples early morning or late afternoon (cooler, better light for photos, fewer crowds).

6. **Waterproof Your Valuables:** Use dry bag for phone/wallet/camera when on boats or near water.

7. **Pack a Light Layer:** Indoor AC can be intense (malls, restaurants, flights). Light cardigan or hoodie useful.

8. **Bring Small Bills:** For tipping, small purchases at markets. Break large bills at hotels/restaurants.

9. **Photo Backups:** Back up photos daily (cloud or second device). Humidity can damage electronics.

10. **Flexibility:** Bali runs on "island time" - things may not go exactly on schedule. Relax and enjoy!
