- 🚭 **No Smoking:** Banned in all indoor public spaces

### Practical Tips

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR BUSINESS TRAVEL

1. **Suit Packing:** Use garment sleeve or fold jacket inside-out along seams. Pack with tissue paper to prevent wrinkles. Hang immediately upon arrival.

2. **Wrinkle Release:** Hang clothes in bathroom during hot shower. Steam helps release wrinkles without iron.

3. **Power Strategy:** Keep all chargers in laptop bag. Charge everything overnight. Power bank for day use.

4. **Oyster Card:** Buy at airport vending machine. Tap in/out on Tube and buses. Much cheaper than individual tickets.

5. **Business Cards:** British exchange cards but less frequently than Asian cultures. Have ready but don't force.

6. **Jet Lag (if crossing zones):** Stay awake until local evening time. Get morning sunlight. Avoid alcohol on flight.

7. **Backup Suit:** Two suits means you're never without if spill happens. Rotate to stay fresh.

8. **Shoe Comfort:** Lots of walking. If dress shoes uncomfortable, pack cushion inserts.

9. **Conference Networking:** Arrive early to sessions, sit near front, introduce yourself at breaks.

10. **Local SIM:** If need data, buy at airport (£10-20 for week). Or check if hotel/venue has Wi-Fi.
