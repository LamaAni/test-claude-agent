# Traveler Rules

## Purpose

## Gender-Specific Packing Needs

### Female Travelers

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Feminine hygiene products**: Essential, calculate quantity based on trip length
- **Makeup and skincare**: Often more extensive than male travelers
- **Hair care**: Products, tools (hair dryer, straightener, etc.)

**Typical Additional Weight:** 2-3kg compared to male equivalent

**Clothing Considerations:**
- More outfit combinations needed
- Dress/skirt options for warm weather
- Additional undergarments
- More footwear variety often expected
- Layering pieces (cardigans, wraps)

**Toiletry Additions:**

**Safety Considerations:**

### Male Travelers

- Repeat outfits more socially acceptable
- Fewer layers and options needed

**Business Travel:**
- Multiple suits/shirts for professional appearances

- Professional grooming items

### Non-Binary/Gender-Diverse Travelers

**Approach:** Ask preferences or default to comprehensive list
- Include options from all categories as relevant
- Focus on personal comfort and expression
- Respect individual needs

**Agent Behavior:**
- If specified, ask: "What packing considerations are important to you?"
- If not specified, provide inclusive recommendations
- Avoid assumptions based solely on name or demographics

## Age-Based Requirements

### Infants (0-2 years)

**Essential Items:**
- **Diapers**: Estimate 8-10 per day, or plan to buy on-site

- Books or entertainment (swap)
- Laundry supplies

**Distribute Weight:**
- Split shared items between bags
- Heavier person can carry more
- Balance for easy handling by each person

**Redundancy Decisions:**
- Critical items: Each has their own (medications, documents)
- Convenience items: Share
- Clothing: Separate (usually)

**Example:**
```
Without coordination:
- Person 1: 20kg (including own toiletries, adapter, first aid)
- Person 2: 20kg (including own toiletries, adapter, first aid)
- Total: 40kg, 2 checked bags

With coordination:
- Person 1: 18kg (shared toiletries, adapter, first aid)
- Person 2: 18kg (clothing only, some shared items)
- Total: 36kg, 2 checked bags
- Savings: 4kg = room for souvenirs or lighter packing
```

### Families (Adults + Children)

**Packing Strategy:**

**Shared Family Items:**
- Large toiletry bottles (not travel size)
- Laundry detergent
- First aid kit (family-size)
- Sunscreen (big bottle)
- Entertainment (shared iPad, books)

**Distribution:**
- Parent bags: Heavy, shared, fragile items
- Child bags: Their own clothing and small entertainment
- Car seat/stroller: Check if possible (free on airlines)

**Clothing Coordination:**
- Color-coordinate for easy identification
- Similar items for washing together
- All-family rain gear if destination wet

**Example Family (2 adults, 2 kids ages 6 & 9):**
```

### Groups (Friends, Tour Groups)

**Coordination Opportunities:**

- Share activities gear (if rental or bringing)
- Distribute group items (snacks, games)

**Considerations:**

## Multi-Traveler Luggage Optimization

### Scenario: Family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids)

- Each person manages own bag
- Heavy for kids to handle

**Option 2: Shared Family Bags**
- 2 large checked bags (adults manage)
- 2 kid backpacks (carry-on)
- $0-100 in fees
- Better organization
- Adults handle heavy lifting

**Recommendation:** Option 2
- Cost effective
- Age-appropriate
- Better logistics at destinations

### Distribution Strategy

**Checked Bag 1 (Adult manages):**
- Adult 1 clothing
- Kid 1 clothing
- Shared toiletries
- First aid

**Checked Bag 2 (Adult manages):**

- Split critical items (meds in carry-on anyway)

## Family Packing Strategies
