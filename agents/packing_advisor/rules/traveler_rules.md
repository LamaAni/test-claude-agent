# Traveler Rules

## Purpose

### Non-Binary / Prefer Not to Say

- Don't make assumptions about style or products needed

## Age-Based Requirements

### Infants (0-12 months)

**Unique Items:**

## Number of Travelers Coordination

### Solo Traveler

**Advantages:**
- All luggage allowance for one person
- Flexible packing
- Can carry own bags

**Packing Strategy:**
- Maximize efficiency
- Can go carry-on only easier
- All space is yours

### Couple (2 People)

**Advantages:**

- Can specialize bags (clothes in one, gear in other)

**Packing Strategy:**

  - Toiletries (share shampoo, toothpaste, etc.)
  - First aid kit
  - Travel adapters
  - Laundry supplies
- **Individual Items Split:**
  - Each person's clothing
  - Personal medications
  - Personal electronics

**Weight Distribution:**
- Example: Two 23kg allowances = 46kg total
- Distribute heavy shared items evenly
- Each carries personal essentials in carry-on (redundancy)

**Efficiency Gains:**
- Save: 1-2kg by sharing toiletries
- Save: Space by sharing adapters, first aid
- Can pack more specialty items

### Family (3-4 People)

**Coordination Critical:**
- Strategic packing across multiple bags
- Shared family items
- Mix-and-match if one bag lost

**Packing Strategy:**
- **Family Shared Items:**
  - Toiletries (one set for family)
  - First aid (comprehensive kit)
  - Electronics/adapters (one set)
  - Beach/activity gear
  - Laundry supplies
- **Individual Items:**
  - Each person's clothing

  - Comfort items (for kids)

**Weight Distribution Example (Family of 4):**
```
Parent 1: 22kg checked + carry-on
  - Parent 1 clothing: 6kg
  - Child 1 clothing: 4kg
  - Shared toiletries: 2kg
  - Shared gear: 10kg

Parent 2: 22kg checked + carry-on
  - Parent 2 clothing: 6kg
  - Child 2 clothing: 4kg
  - More shared gear: 12kg

Child 1: Carry-on only (3kg)
  - Personal items, entertainment, comfort items

Child 2: Carry-on only (3kg)
  - Personal items, entertainment, comfort items

Total: 44kg checked + 6kg carry-on = 50kg
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Each bag has at least one person's complete outfit (in case of loss)
- Critical items split across bags (don't put all medications in one bag)
- Kids carry change of clothes in carry-on

### Large Group (5+ People)

**Significant Coordination:**

- Share bulky items extensively
- Spreadsheet recommended for tracking

**Shared Items Across Group:**

## Multi-Traveler Luggage Optimization

### Shared Item Savings

**Example Calculations:**
```
SOLO TRAVELER:
  Toiletries: 1.5kg
  First Aid: 0.5kg
  Adapters: 0.3kg
  Total Shared: 2.3kg

COUPLE:
  Toiletries: 1.8kg (one set, slightly larger sizes)
  First Aid: 0.6kg
  Adapters: 0.3kg
  Total Shared: 2.7kg
  Per Person: 1.35kg
  SAVINGS PER PERSON: 0.95kg

FAMILY OF 4:
  Toiletries: 2.0kg (family sizes)
  First Aid: 0.8kg
  Adapters: 0.3kg
  Total Shared: 3.1kg
  Per Person: 0.775kg
  SAVINGS PER PERSON: 1.525kg
```

**Shared Item Strategy:**
- Larger sizes more efficient (one 200ml shampoo vs four 50ml)
- One comprehensive set vs. multiple partial sets
- Share electronics (one hair dryer, not four)

### Weight Distribution Tactics

**Balance Across Travelers:**
```
Example: Couple, one person has heavy business gear

Traveler A (business):
  - Laptop, documents: 3kg
  - Business clothing: 6kg
  - Personal items: 6kg
  - Total: 15kg

Traveler B:
  - Shared toiletries: 2kg
  - Both travelers' casual clothing: 10kg
  - Shared gear: 8kg
  - Total: 20kg

Result: Balanced load (15kg vs 20kg)
```

**Strategic Packing:**
- Heavier person can carry more comfortably
- Person with mobility issues carries less
- Distribute based on strength and comfort

## Family Packing Strategies

### Packing Cubes by Person
- Each family member gets a color
- Easy to find items
- Easy to distribute across bags
- Quick to reorganize

### Outfit Bundles for Kids
- Pre-match outfits (saves decision time)
- Roll together as units
- Kids can pick by bundle number
- Reduces morning stress

### Emergency Carry-On for Each Person
Every family member's carry-on includes:
- 1 complete outfit
- Essential medication
- Entertainment
- Snack
- Comfort item (for kids)

**Why:** If checked bags delayed, everyone can survive first day.

### Laundry Strategy for Families
- Essential for trips over 5 days
- Reduces clothing by 40-50%
- Kids' clothes: Small, quick to wash/dry
- Plan: Midpoint laundry or every 3-4 days

### Kid Entertainment Distribution
- Spread across carry-ons
- Share electronics (tablets with kid-friendly content)
- Include non-electronic (coloring books, small toys)
- Rotate to maintain interest

## Communication in Recommendations

### Always Specify Traveler Details

**Good Example:**
```
👥 TRAVELERS
