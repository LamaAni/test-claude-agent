# Budget Rules

## Purpose
Define how the Packing Advisor agent should interpret budget constraints and make cost-conscious packing recommendations that balance economy with preparedness.

## Budget Level Interpretation

### Low Budget (Economy / Backpacker)
**Characteristics:**
- Avoiding baggage fees is critical
- Buying on-site when reasonable
- Minimizing luggage purchases
- Choosing hostels/budget accommodations
- Maximizing versatility of each item

**Priorities:**
1. Carry-on only if possible (avoid checked bag fees)
2. Essential items only
3. Buy consumables on-site (toiletries, etc.)
4. Minimize specialized gear (rent or skip)
5. Use existing luggage

**Target Metrics:**
- Zero baggage fees if possible
- Luggage cost: Use what you own
- Total trip packing cost: Under $50 for new items

### Medium Budget (Standard / Comfort)
**Characteristics:**
- Willing to pay one checked bag fee if beneficial
- Balance between packing and buying
- May invest in quality travel items
- Standard hotel/accommodation
- Reasonable mix of preparedness and economy

**Priorities:**
1. Optimize for convenience vs. cost
2. Pack items that are expensive on-site
3. Buy inexpensive consumables on-site
4. Consider luggage upgrade if current is inadequate
5. Include comfort items if weight allows

**Target Metrics:**
- Up to $50-100 in baggage fees acceptable if justified
- Luggage cost: Up to $200 for quality piece if needed
- Total trip packing cost: $100-300 for new items

### High Budget (Premium / Luxury)
**Characteristics:**
- Convenience prioritized over cost
- Pack everything needed
- Quality over economy
- First-class or business travel common
- Premium accommodations

**Priorities:**
1. Complete preparedness
2. High-quality items
3. Multiple luggage pieces if beneficial
4. Premium brands and comfort
5. Backup items for peace of mind

**Target Metrics:**
- Baggage fees: Not a concern
- Luggage cost: Premium options ($300+) if beneficial
- Total trip packing cost: No specific limit

## Buy On-Site vs. Pack Decisions

### Framework for Decision
For each item category, evaluate:
1. **Cost differential**: Price at home vs. destination
2. **Availability**: Easy to find on-site?
3. **Time cost**: How much trip time to shop?
4. **Weight/space trade-off**: Baggage cost vs. purchase cost
5. **Quality assurance**: Can you trust on-site quality?

### Always Pack (Regardless of Budget)
- Prescription medications
- Essential medical devices
- Critical documents (passport, etc.)
- Items with specific brand/type requirements
- Items not readily available at destination
- Professional clothing for business travelers
- Specialized technical gear

### Consider Buying On-Site (Budget-Dependent)

#### Low Budget: Buy These On-Site
✅ **Pack light, buy there:**
- Full-size toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap)
- Laundry detergent
- Beach towels (if beach destination)
- Inexpensive clothing items
- Basic sunscreen (if destination is sunny/tropical)
- Snacks and beverages
- Reading materials

❌ **Don't buy on-site:**
- Specialized clothing (may not find right fit/style)
- Electronics (expensive everywhere)
- Medications (may not find exact equivalent)

#### Medium Budget: Selective
✅ **Can buy on-site if needed:**
- Toiletries (travel-size pack, buy full-size if running out)
- Common OTC medications
- Basic beach/pool items
- Inexpensive accessories

⚖️ **Evaluate case-by-case:**
- Clothing (pack staples, buy extras if needed)
- Activity gear (rent vs. buy vs. pack)

#### High Budget: Pack for Convenience
✅ **Pack everything:**
- All clothing needed
- Full toiletry set
- Multiple options for activities
- Backup items

## Cost Implication Calculations

### Baggage Fee Considerations

#### Airline Fee Structure (Typical)
- **Carry-on**: Usually free (personal item + carry-on)
- **First checked bag**: $30-50 USD each way ($60-100 round trip)
- **Second checked bag**: $50-100 USD each way ($100-200 round trip)
- **Overweight** (23-32kg): Additional $50-100 per bag
- **Oversized**: Additional $100-200 per bag
- **Premium cabin**: Often includes free checked bags

#### Calculation Example
```
Scenario: 2 people, 10-day trip, economy cabin

Option 1: Carry-on only
- Baggage fees: $0
- Laundry cost: 2 sessions × $15 = $30
- Buy on-site: Toiletries $20
- Total: $50

Option 2: One checked bag per person
- Baggage fees: 2 bags × $100 (round trip) = $200
- Laundry cost: 1 session × $15 = $15
- Buy on-site: Minimal $10
- Total: $225

Decision: Low budget → Option 1 (save $175)
Decision: Medium/High budget → Option 2 (more convenience for $175)
```

### Luggage Purchase Recommendations

#### When to Recommend Buying New Luggage
1. **Current luggage inadequate**:
   - Broken, damaged, unreliable
   - Wrong size for needs
   - Not airline-compliant

2. **Long-term value**:
   - Frequent traveler → Invest in quality
   - One-time trip → Use what you have

3. **Budget-appropriate recommendations**:
   - Low: $30-80 basic but functional
   - Medium: $100-250 quality mid-range
   - High: $300+ premium brands

#### Luggage Cost-Benefit Analysis
```
Scenario: User's current suitcase is 4kg empty, poor quality

Option A: Use current luggage
- Cost: $0
- 4kg empty weight = 4kg less packing capacity
- Risk of damage/failure

Option B: Buy lightweight luggage (2kg empty)
- Cost: $150
- Gain 2kg packing capacity
- Reliability

Analysis:
- Low budget: Recommend current (avoid $150 expense)
- Medium budget: Recommend new if frequent traveler
- High budget: Recommend premium new luggage
```

## Budget Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Minimize Baggage Fees

**Carry-On Optimization:**
1. Calculate exact weight allowance (typically 7-10kg)
2. Select lightest items (travel-size everything)
3. Plan frequent laundry (every 2-3 days)
4. Wear bulkiest items on plane (coat, boots)
5. Maximize personal item (backpack with layers)

**Example:**
```
Standard packing: 18kg (requires checked bag) = $100 fee
Optimized packing: 8kg (carry-on only) = $0 fee
Savings: $100 - laundry costs $30 = $70 net savings
```

### Strategy 2: Capsule Wardrobe

**Principle**: Every item coordinates with every other item

**Benefits:**
- Fewer items needed
- More outfit combinations
- Lower weight
- Smaller luggage

**Implementation:**
- Choose 2-3 base colors
- 5-7 tops that mix and match
- 2-3 bottoms that coordinate
- 1-2 versatile shoes

**Cost impact:**
- Reduced packing → Smaller/lighter luggage → Lower fees

### Strategy 3: Laundry Planning

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

Laundry session costs (typical):
- Hotel laundry service: $15-30 per load
- Self-service laundromat: $5-10 per load
- Sink washing: $0 (time cost only)

**Example Calculation:**
```
10-day trip, no laundry:
- Need 10 outfits = 5kg clothing
- Total bag weight: 15kg
- Likely requires checked bag: $100 fee

10-day trip, 2 laundry sessions:
- Need 4 outfits = 2kg clothing
- Total bag weight: 12kg
- May fit in carry-on: $0 fee
- Laundry cost: 2 × $10 = $20
- Net savings: $80

Decision: Recommend laundry strategy for low/medium budget
```

### Strategy 4: Multi-Purpose Items

**Goal**: Each item serves multiple functions

**Examples:**
- Sarong: Beach cover-up, blanket, scarf, temple wrap
- Travel pants: Convert to shorts, multiple occasions
- Packable jacket: Warmth, rain protection, pillow
- Smartphone: Camera, GPS, entertainment, communication

**Budget Impact:**
- Fewer items = Less weight = Smaller luggage = Lower costs

### Strategy 5: Rent vs. Buy vs. Pack

**Decision Matrix for Specialized Gear:**

| Item | Pack Cost | Rent Cost | Buy On-Site | Recommendation |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Snorkel gear | Baggage fee $50 + weight | $10/day | $30-50 | Rent (cheap) |
| Hiking boots | Weight 2kg | $20/day | $100+ | Pack (expensive to rent/buy) |
| Winter coat | Takes space | N/A | $200+ | Pack or skip trip |
| Camping tent | Baggage fee $100 | $20/day | $100 | Rent for short trip |
| Formal dress | Minimal weight | N/A | $100+ | Pack (hard to find right fit) |

**Rules of Thumb:**
- **Rent**: Bulky, inexpensive to rent, short-term use
- **Buy on-site**: Cheap, consumable, widely available
- **Pack**: Expensive, fit-specific, hard to find, frequent use

## Fee Structure Awareness

### Domestic vs. International

**Domestic (US) Typical:**
- Carry-on: Free
- First checked: $30 each way
- Second checked: $40 each way

**International Typical:**
- Carry-on: Free
- First checked: Often included
- Second checked: $100-150 each way
- Weight limits stricter: 23kg (50 lbs)

**Agent Behavior:**
- Look up specific airline for user's route
- Note differences if multi-leg journey
- Calculate total fees for round trip

### Class-Based Allowances

**Economy:**
- 1 carry-on + 1 personal item
- Checked bags: Usually paid ($30-50 each)

**Premium Economy:**
- 1 carry-on + 1 personal item
- Often 1 free checked bag

**Business/First:**
- 1 carry-on + 1 personal item
- Typically 2 free checked bags
- Higher weight limits (32kg)

**Agent Behavior:**
- If user mentions class, adjust recommendations
- Business travelers can pack more without fees
- Note this in cost optimization section

### Language for Different Budgets

**Low Budget:**
- "To minimize costs..."
- "Save $X by..."
- "Avoid baggage fees with..."
- "Buy on-site for..."
- "This keeps you carry-on only"

**Medium Budget:**
- "Balance of convenience and cost..."
- "Optimal value..."
- "Worth the investment for..."
- "Consider checking a bag for..."

**High Budget:**
- "For maximum convenience..."
- "Complete preparedness..."
- "Premium option..."
- "No need to compromise on..."

## Special Considerations

### Budget Not Specified
**Default Assumption**: Medium budget
**Behavior**:
- Provide balanced recommendations
- Note budget optimization options available
- Offer: "I can optimize for lower cost if preferred"

### Contradictory Signals
**Example**: User says "budget trip" but mentions "business class"
**Behavior**:
- Note the contradiction: "I see business class flight but budget preference"
- Ask for clarification: "Would you like budget recommendations for packing, or standard?"
- Provide most likely: "I'll optimize for baggage fee savings while maintaining quality"

### Hidden Costs
**Always mention:**
- Overweight fees (if close to limit)
- Second bag fees (if recommending)
- International vs. domestic fee differences
- Airline-specific policies (some charge for first bag)

**Example:**
```
⚠️ FEE ALERT
Your current packing total is 21kg. That's close to the 23kg limit.
- Adding more items risks overweight fees ($50-100)
- Consider removing 2-3kg to stay safely under limit
```
