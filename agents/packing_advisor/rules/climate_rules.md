## Climate Zone Recommendations

### Tropical (Hot year-round, high humidity)
**Examples**: Southeast Asia, Caribbean, Central America

**Year-round packing:**
- Light, breathable clothing
- Strong sun protection
- Rain jacket (afternoon showers common)
- Moisture-wicking fabrics
- Antibacterial items

**Special**: Modest dress for temples/religious sites

### Arid/Desert (Hot days, cool nights, low humidity)
**Examples**: Middle East, Southwest US, parts of Africa

**Key items:**
- Sun protection (extreme)
- Layering (significant day/night temperature swings)
- Light, loose clothing for day
- Warmer layer for evening
- Extra moisturizer

**Special**: Modest dress in many regions

### Temperate (Four distinct seasons)
**Examples**: Most of Europe, Northern US, Japan

**Season-dependent**: Follow seasonal guidelines above

**Key**: Check specific month and weather forecast

### Mediterranean (Mild, wet winters; hot, dry summers)
**Examples**: Southern Europe, California, parts of Australia

**Summer** (May-Sep): Hot and dry, sun protection
**Winter** (Nov-Mar): Mild and wet, rain gear

### Continental (Extreme seasonal variation)
**Examples**: Central US, Central Asia, Eastern Europe

**Summer**: Very hot (25-35°C), sun protection
**Winter**: Very cold (-20 to -5°C), full winter gear

**Key**: Dramatic seasonal differences, pack accordingly

### Polar/Subpolar (Cold year-round)
**Examples**: Iceland, Alaska, Scandinavia

**Even summer**: Cool (5-15°C), need warm layers
**Winter**: Extreme cold (< -20°C), specialized gear

**Key**: Always pack warm, even in "summer"

## Special Considerations

### High Altitude (>2500m / 8000ft)
**Effects**: 
- Cooler temperatures (drops ~6°C per 1000m)
- Stronger UV radiation
- Lower oxygen (affects exertion)

**Packing adjustments:**
- Warmer clothes than lowland equivalent temp
- Higher SPF sunscreen
- Lip balm with SPF
- Layers for temperature swings

**Examples**: Denver, Cusco, Lhasa, Swiss Alps

### Coastal vs. Inland
**Coastal**: More moderate, humid, breezy
**Inland**: More extreme, drier, less wind

**Packing impact**: Coastal slightly more comfortable, less extreme gear needed

### Urban Heat Island
**Effect**: Cities 2-5°C warmer than surrounding areas

**Packing**: Account for additional heat in city exploration

## Integration with Other Rules

### Cultural Norms Override Climate
**Example**: Hot destination with modest dress requirements
- Climate says: Tank tops and shorts
- Culture says: Shoulders and knees covered
- **Solution**: Light, breathable but modest clothing (linen long sleeve, loose pants)

### Activity Requirements Override Comfort
**Example**: Cold destination with swimming
- Climate says: Winter coat
- Activity says: Swimsuit
- **Solution**: Both included, plan for temperature transitions

### Budget Constraints Affect Options
**Example**: Extreme cold destination, low budget
- Optimal: High-tech layering system ($500)
- Budget: Thrift store layers + hand warmers ($50)
- **Solution**: Recommend budget-friendly layering, prioritize essentials
